# DataSetDetectionPatterns
An implementation for the various patterns I've come up with for identifying changes in DataSets.   

##Patterns:
* ChangingStatus
* KeyColumnHash
* BruteForceFullTable

# Intro.

When working of software projects I regularly come across a requirement for some level of change information to be provided on a source.  Whether 
it is a simple csv file that's regularly received or a table in a database where CDC/Change tracking isn't feasible.   This repository is an attempt 
at putting some of the approaches I've taken into an easy to use package.
